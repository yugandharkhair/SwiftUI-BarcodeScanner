# SwiftUI-BarcodeScanner
So this marks my third app which was built in SwiftUI and my god! I learnt and understood so many new concepts in the framework that I had to take it slow to absorb all those in my brain. Learnt about AVFoundation and how we can capture Audio + Video input in SwiftUI. Couldn't say I understood it 100%, but honestly it was great! Following are the features of this app- Basic app that shows number of a scanned barcode, specifically of types EAN-8 and EAN-13; Also gives alerts if the app cannot access the camera or if we scan something that is not a barcode.

What I learnt from building this app-
* Error handling! How to create error handling statements and alert generation in iOS.
* AVFoundation (A little bit), How to take camera input in an app.
* What co-ordinators are and how they work.
* SwiftUI Delegates.

Another great app from Sean Allen. Looking forwards to building the next ambitious app. Here's how this one looks!

p.s. I screen recorded the app on my iPhone.
